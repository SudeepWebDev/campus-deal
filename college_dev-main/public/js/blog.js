          <h3>Some tried and tested tips are:</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>De-stress Yourself with Breaks</h4>
          
          Breaks are indeed necessary if you want to enjoy your studies. And, hence, even the most extraordinary study timetables should permit at least a short break. You can space out your breaks evenly throughout your study schedule. Do plan out a 10-minute break after every 1.5 hours of study. This will facilitate better absorption of the concepts and will keep you invigorated throughout. Engage in your favorite activities during your break time and youâ€™ll see how these short breaks will do wonders in taking your exam fever and stress off your mind.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Exercise Regularly</h4>
          
          Adding Exercise to your daily routine is a good way to rejuvenate yourself and fill in positive energy. This helps improve your concentration power and builds focus. Get involved in Yoga classes or simply meditate in the morning. This will help you get relaxed and will help bring the change for better.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Tune in to your Favorite Music</h4>
          <br>
          Listening to music is one of the best activities when it comes to bidding goodbye to stress. Tuning in to the music of your choice can create a positive environment and lift your mood. Though traditional music is prescribed as the best sort of music to help boost your brain power but you can definitely choose the music you like as it will help you to get refreshed after hectic study schedule.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Sleep Well</h4>
          <br>
          Studies have revealed that seven to eight hours sleep pattern is necessary for the body to function well. Hence, it is important to take a sound sleep of at least eight hours during the exam days as well. Try and take proper rest and sleep well so that you get up refreshed and your mind can capture its maximum efficiency.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Take Good Care of your Diet</h4>
          <br>
          Green leafy vegetables and food rich in proteins and vitamins are must for students. Taking proper nutrients and healthy diet helps to keep your brain active, healthy, and sharp. Try and avoid fried foods as they are heavy on the stomach and may make you feel lethargic and sleepy. Also, avoid too much intake of caffeine as it negatively impacts your health. Instead, drink adequate amounts of water as it will not only keep you hydrated but will also keep you fresh and active.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Stay Positive</h4>
          <br>
          Spend time with people who have a positive aura. Try and maintain as much positivity as possible as it will help you stay focused and full of vigor.`,

      <h3>Here are some tips:</h3>
      <br>

      Make sure you understand the terms of your student loans, including the interest rates, repayment plans, and any other conditions or requirements. This will help you make informed decisions about how to manage your debt.
      <br><br>
      <h4>Create a Budget:</h4> 
      Create a budget that takes into account your income, expenses, and student loan payments. This will help you prioritize your spending and ensure that you're making your loan payments on time.
      <br><br>
